# Week 5 Report

## What I've done this week

- Heuristics have different weights depeneding on the phase of the game
- Instead of making copies of the game, the minimax now uses a stack to keep track of the moves
- Added a restart button to the GUI thanks to my classmate's feedback
- Made a starting menu to choose the color of the players

## State of program

The game now has an AI that depending on the stage of the game will focus on different things and it is actually really hard to beat.

## Learned this week

- How to choose which heuristics to use depending on the stage of the game
- How to customize a GUI using TKinter and create a custom popup message window
- How to create a menu to choose the color of the players

## Difficulties I encountered

- Making the GUI more aesthetically pleasing with TKinter, because I want everything to have the same color palette and doing it for the popup windows was very tedious, but my perfectionist inside is now satisfied.
- I had some problems when making the choose color menu because I wanted to make the buttons appear and then show the board once the color was chosen, but well I did a workaround that its not the same but I like it, also it took me some time to manage to make the buttons appear and work properly when the game was restarted.

## Next week

- Finish all the documentation
- May add the cache to the minimax that Hannu suggested if I learn how to do it
- I also may try to implement different difficulty levels but it is not a priority
- I think the rest of the project is pretty much done
