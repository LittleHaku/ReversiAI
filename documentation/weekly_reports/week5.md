# Week 5 Report

## What I've done this week

- Heuristics have different weights depeneding on the phase of the game
- Instead of making copies of the game, the minimax now uses a stack to keep track of the moves
- Added a restart button to the GUI thanks to my classmate's feedback

## State of program

The game now has an AI that depending on the stage of the game will focus on different things and it is actually really hard to beat.

## Learned this week

- How to choose which heuristics to use depending on the stage of the game
- How to customize a GUI using TKinter and create a custom popup message window

## Difficulties I encountered

- Making the GUI more aesthetically pleasing with TKinter

## Next week

- Make the heuristics differentiate early and late game.
- I may try to implement a menu, but the main focus it's on the AI.
- Find another way to execute the minimax without making game copies
