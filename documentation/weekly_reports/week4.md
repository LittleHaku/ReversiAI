# Week 3 Report

## What I've done this week

- I've added heuristics that take into account the number of pieces, where they are placed, the number of possible moves, how many pieces can be flipped, etc.
- I have added different weight to each of the heuristics.

## State of program

The program now has an AI that is able to play properly and it is actyally hard to beat.

## Learned this week

- I've learned how to make heuristics for a board game

## Difficulties I encountered

- I had some difficulties normalizing the values of the heuristics but I managed to do it.

## Next week

- Make the heuristics differentiate early and late game.
- I may try to implement a menu, but the main focus it's on the AI.
- Find another way to execute the minimax without making game copies
