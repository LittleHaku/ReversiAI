# Week 1 Report

## What I've done this week

This week I've read all the information on Moodle as well as on the <https://tiralabra.github.io/2021_p1/en/> and noted down the most important things, such as what needs to be submitted, the grading criteria, documentation, etc.

After reading that I started looking at the different topics and since games was one of the options I chose Reversi since I know how the game works and I thought it's a game which would be very suitable for an AI.

Then I researched about different implementations of AIs for Reversi and decided that I was going to use minimax with alphabeta pruning and heuristics to evaluate the nodes.

I created the git project and worked on the project specification.

## State of program

The program hasn't got any code yet, but I've thought about how to make it and the different algorithms and data structures that I will use to implement it, they are reflected in the project specification.

## Learned this week

- I've learned more about alphabeta pruning, how it works and its complexity.
- I've learned what things should an heuristic take into account when evaluating a reversi game.

## Difficulties I encountered

- I had some difficulties knowing what to do, since the documentation isn't very straight forward and all the time refers to other documents so I got kind of lost and overwhelmed at the beginning.
- I'm also not sure if the project specification is done correctly since maybe I later need other data structures or algorithms that I haven't thought about yet.

## Next week

- I will start coding the game with a GUI so it can be played by a human first.
- If I have time I will start implementing the AI.
- I will also document all the code I write.
